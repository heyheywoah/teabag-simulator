# TEABAG SIMULATOR

You know that move in online games that makes you want to throw your controller through the TV? The one that's been getting people reported since Halo 2? Yeah, we made a whole game about it.

Jump on strangers. Crouch repeatedly. Watch numbers go up. Question your life choices. Repeat.

Works on desktop and mobile. Add to home screen on your phone for the full degenerate experience.

## How To Play

Land on an NPC's head to mount them. Mash crouch to teabag. Each bob does damage. KO them, launch off, land on the next one. Chain KOs for multipliers. That's it. That's the game.

## Mechanics

- **Mounting** — Land on an NPC's head from above. They panic.
- **Teabagging** — Rapidly crouch/uncrouch while mounted. Each bob within the timing window deals damage and builds combo.
- **Combo** — Consecutive teabags on a single NPC. Increases damage per hit.
- **Chain Combo** — KO an NPC, launch off, mount another within 3 seconds. Chain multiplier applies to score. Timer refreshes on each mount.
- **Aerial Bonus** — Mount a new NPC while your chain is active for bonus points.
- **Double Jump** — Jump again mid-air. Puff ring particle effect.
- **Sprint** — Double-tap a direction. 2.31x speed. Preserves momentum in air.
- **Coyote Time** — 80ms grace period to jump after leaving a ledge.
- **Jump Buffer** — 100ms input buffer for pre-landing jumps.
- **Drop Through** — Crouch on a platform to fall through it (Smash Bros style).
- **Prestige** — Campaign only. Walk past the final zone to loop. NPCs get +50% HP per prestige. Visual effects stack.

## World Generation

Everything is procedurally generated in both directions as you move:

- **Buildings** — Zone-specific architecture (skyscrapers, storefronts, pavilions, warehouses, houses) with foreground (0.7x parallax) and background (0.3x parallax) layers
- **Silhouettes** — Deep background layer (0.05x parallax) with zone-appropriate shapes
- **Platforms** — Smash Bros-style one-way platforms, randomly distributed
- **Bus Stops** — Downtown only. Custom sprite shelter with 1-5 NPCs who panic when you're nearby. Rare Goth Mommy spawn.
- **Props** — Zone-specific (lamps, hydrants, benches, trees, fountains, neon signs, barrels, smokestacks, mailboxes, fences)
- **Traffic** — Sedans, SUVs, sports cars, vans, pickups, and buses drive behind the sidewalk layer
- **Zone Blending** — 600-unit crossfade between zones (sky tint, ground pattern, silhouettes, building styles)

## Day/Night Cycle

300-second cycle (5 minutes = 24 hours). 12 sky gradient stops from midnight through dawn, sunrise, noon, golden hour, sunset, dusk, and back. Stars twinkle at night. Building windows light up. Ambient darkness overlay.

## SFX

10 synthesized sound effects built with the Web Audio API — no audio files. Sounds are defined as modular node graphs in `sfx/sounds.js` and played by an inline engine in the game.

| Sound          | Trigger                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| jump           | First jump               |
| doubleJump     | Second jump              |
| land           | Hard landing (vy > 200)  |
| mount          | Landing on an NPC's head |
| teabagHit      | Each teabag bob          |
| ko             | NPC health reaches 0     |
| menuSelect     | Confirming a menu option |
| menuNav        | Navigating menus         |
| zoneTransition | Entering a new zone      |
| prestige       | Completing the zone loop |

Volume and mute controls in the pause menu. Persisted to localStorage.

## Dev Tools

### Sound Designer (`sound-designer.html`)

Standalone tool for crafting game sounds using the Web Audio API. Modular synth-style node graph with:

- **4 layers per sound** — Each with its own source, waveshaper, filter, LFO, and gain
- **Source types** — Sine, square, sawtooth, triangle, white/pink/brown noise, FM synthesis
- **Effects chain** — Delay, reverb, chorus, phaser, compressor, distortion, EQ, bitcrusher, tremolo
- **ADSR envelope** — Attack, decay, sustain, release with visual curve
- **Real-time visualization** — Oscilloscope waveform, frequency spectrum, envelope/filter curves
- **12 sound slots** with randomize, copy/paste, export JSON, import JSON, copy as JS
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Space to preview, R to randomize, 1-0 for quick slot select

### NPC Character Designer (`npc-designer.html`)

Standalone character-authoring tool for building layered NPC pose sheets before game integration.

- **Editable base forms** — Start from `male_base` or `female_base`, then fully edit every base layer
- **Three independent poses** — `normal`, `panic`, `ko` workspaces with copy-pose actions
- **Tool surface** — Select, move, resize handles, rectangle, ellipse, line, curve, polygon, color, gradient, eyedropper, hand + zoom controls
- **Layer workflow** — Multi-select (Shift/Cmd/Ctrl), rename, reorder, hide/show, lock/unlock, duplicate, delete, group move/resize
- **Face controls** — Dedicated managed face panel for eyes, brows, and mouth that updates layer geometry used by runtime parity preview/export
- **Hair preset bootstrap** — Apply a layered Sundress hair preset (current pose or all poses) with back mass, temple coverage, and front bangs/wisps ready for fine tuning
- **Height references** — Toggle lines and labels derived from current game character dimensions (plus optional silhouette overlays)
- **Live previews** — Side-by-side previews for all three poses with facing-direction toggle; panic preview now derives from normal geometry with panic-face substitution, adjustable panic arm spread, and adjustable shoulder-bar pivot offset (plus `Snap 0` reset for spread)
- **Runtime-parity preview** — Dedicated preview panel that calls the shared game `drawCharacter` renderer using live in-memory designer payload data (`designerPayload` + `designerPose`) with legacy fallback safety, plus pose/facing/scale/tick controls, a Start/Stop animation loop toggle, world-context silhouettes, and panic motion flags aligned to game NPC panic (`isFleeing` + walk phase, no jump-state injection)
- **Constraint UX** — Always-visible Design Readiness panel and Constraint Reference panel with hard blockers vs warnings and jump-to-target issue navigation
- **Visual-rule override workflow** — Hard Safety rules always block compact export; visual issues become warnings when Strict Visual Rules is OFF (optional auto-fix when strict is ON)
- **JSON round-trip** — Export/import full editable JSON, copy/download JSON, plus compact integration payload export for downstream character conversion
- **Session persistence + snapshots** — Auto-recovers current workspace from localStorage and adds simple Save/Save As/Load session snapshots (with unsaved-change confirmation on load)
- **Runtime payload reintegration path** — Game runtime loads `data/npc_payloads/index.json`, resolves optional `designerPayloadId`, maps poses (`normal`/`panic`/`ko`), and falls back to legacy NPC rendering on any index/load/parse/lookup failure
- **Gallery-only runtime sample** — Tab gallery includes a `Designer Sample` entry routed through the runtime payload path without touching spawn pools or gameplay NPC selection

#### NPC Designer Usage

1. Open `npc-designer.html`.
2. Pick a base template (`male_base` or `female_base`).
3. Choose a pose tab (`normal`, `panic`, `ko`) and edit layers.
4. Configure Runtime Preview Profile values (base NPC type, runtime npcType, scale/health/colors/hair/body toggles).
5. Use the `Sundress Hair (Pose)` or `Sundress Hair (All)` preset actions when you want the layered hair starting point.
6. Use Face controls to adjust managed face layers for the active pose (or apply to all poses).
7. Use layer controls for selection/group transforms and ordering.
8. Toggle height references to compare proportions against existing roster sizes.
9. Watch Design Readiness for hard blockers/warnings and use jump links to navigate directly to fields/poses/layers.
10. Use Live Preview `Panic Arm Spread` and `Shoulder Bar Offset Y` to tune panic arm behavior; use `Snap 0` to instantly return spread to an exact flip baseline.
11. Use Runtime-Parity Preview to validate runtime shape/animation parity before export, use `Start Loop` / `Stop Loop` to play animation continuously, and watch the status line for `payload parity active` vs `fallback to legacy preview (...)`.
12. Use the top-bar Session controls: `Save As` creates a named snapshot, `Save` overwrites the selected snapshot, and `Load` restores it (with unsaved-change confirmation).
13. Export editable JSON for continued iteration or import JSON to restore state.
14. Export compact payload when hard blockers are clear.

## Tech
